# How-NN-Works

This is a simple script where the user can see how Neural Networks work inside.

In "networks.py" are defined few types of Neural Network.

In "train.py" is defined "train()" method, that will train our choosen Neural Network.

In How_NN_Works the user can play with parameters and see on plots how Neural Networks work inside.
